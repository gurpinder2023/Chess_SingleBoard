## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java

## 🧠 OOP Principles Applied

- **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates attributes and behaviors.
- **Inheritance**: Base `Piece` class extended by individual pieces (e.g., `King`, `Queen`, `Pawn`).
- **Polymorphism**: Overriding methods for piece-specific movement logic.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes define shared behaviors across components.
